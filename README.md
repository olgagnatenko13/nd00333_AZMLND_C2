## Project Overview 

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.

The purpose of this project is to configure, build, deploy and consume a cloud-based machine learning production model, both manually in AzureML Studio and automatically via a pipeline. 

The project uses the details about the clients of direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution to determine if the clients are likely to subscribe to a bank term deposit. The dataset contains various information about the client: demographic variables, presence of loans, last contact details, outcome of the previous marketing campaign, employment and consumer information. Detailed description of the variables can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing 

**Problem statement**: using the information about the client, assess whether the client will subscribe to a bank term deposit or not. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the most relevant clients for next marketing steps, and to increase bank profit by offering the term deposit product to the proper audience.
